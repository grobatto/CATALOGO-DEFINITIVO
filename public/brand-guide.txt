as 'the sun of our country'.

When it comes to branding, it's important to have
a consistent visual identity across all marketing materials.
This includes using the same logo in various sizes and
formats, such as on a website, business card, or social
media profile. However, sometimes the full logo might not
fit or be appropriate for certain situations, such as when
it needs to be displayed in a small space.

That's where badges or simplified versions of the logo
can be useful. These badges can be created by taking a
small element of the main logo, such
as the octagon in the north of the country in this case,
and using it as a synthesis of the logo. This allows the
brand to maintain a consistent visual identity even in
small or unconventional spaces.

In summary, creating badges or simplified versions of the
logo can be a useful way to ensure a consistent visual
identity across all marketing materials, regardless of size
or format. By using
a small element of the main logo, such as the octagon in
this case, as a synthesis, the brand
can maintain its visual identity while also being flexible
and adaptable to different situations.

Uruguay. Our connection to the region's natural beauty and the
quality of its gems is deeply ingrained in our identity, and we take
pride in sharing our passion for these treasures with the world.
This Brand ID guide is a reflection of our commitment to quality,
tradition, and the natural beauty of our home region. Our aesthetic

deep greens and browns, as well as the purple found in our
amethysts. These colors represent the timeless beauty and
elegance of our gemstones.

brand identity, including our logo, color palette, typography, and
other design elements. We hope this guide serves as a valuable
resource for you as we continue to share our story with the world.

white playing a prominent role in highlighting the natural beauty of
our gems on our landing page and ecommerce. However, we may
use our color palette selectively to reinforce our brand's
personality on occasion.
